# My CV 

Online version of my CV. I used React with TypeScript and styled components (it's just the most comfortable tools for me right now).

### `npm install`
will install all required dependencies, and

### `npm start`
will run the app in the development mode. It should open the browser and start automatically, but in case if something went wrong, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
